Drupal site settings.php file code per chapter 2, page 3.


As this article states, the code you’ll use depends on whether you’re connecting to one database or multiple.  The default Drupal install will have one line of code:

<?php
$db_url = 'mysql://dbusername:dbuserpassword@localhost/dbname';
?>

If you are connecting to multiple databases you’ll want to add another db_url line of code.  Make your main Drupal database your default.  For example:

<?php
$db_url['default'] = 'mysql://dbusername:dbuserpassword@localhost/dbname';
$db_url['db2'] = 'mysql://dbuser:pwd@localhost/anotherdbname';
$db_url['db3'] = 'mysql://dbuser:pwd@localhost/yetanotherdbname';
?>
